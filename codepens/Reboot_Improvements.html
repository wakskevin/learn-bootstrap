    <h1>Rex</h1>
    <p>Rex is the Mayor of Binaryville and a well-loved personality in town. He rose to robotdom from a microprocessor
        plant on the south side of town, where many famous and influential robots before him were conceived.</p>

    <div style="font-size: 35px; color: pink;">
        <h1>Dolores</h1>
        <p>Dolores robot is a computational genius who performs calculations for various Binaryville businesses and
            organizations. In her spare time, Dolores has been noodling on the creation of the perfect web browser that
            will make all other browsers obsolete. We're rooting for you, Dolores!</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Bubbles</h1>
    <p>Bubble Gum robot, or “Bubbles” for short, is from a family of track-footed robots that ¬originated from an
        experiment melding candy vending machines with robotics in the early 1980s. Bubbles is a favorite of
        Binaryville, not just because she generously dispenses candy, but also because she has one of the more "bubbly"
        personalities of the villagers.</p>
