    <p>A growing number of robots were interested in being on the road full-time. Social media influencers Plam and
        Plotter, co-stars of the Travel-Worn Robots TubeYou channel, shared their experience and tips to transitioning
        to life on the road.</p>
    <p>After the session, participants were asked to raise a limb to show how many of them were interested in living
        full-time in their camper, and nearly all said they would love to be full-timers at least part of the time.</p>
