    <p class="lead">While robots have evolved to be able to do pretty much anything, most androids and bots work in the
        construction and manufacturing field as force multipliers. As experts in lifting, moving, and nuts-and-bolting,
        the robotic population is an ideal match for industry and repetitive tasks. As they say in the trades, there’s
        nothing as fun as ennui! And that’s why we strive for our employees to have the most tedious occupations in the
        world. Are you ready to join us?</p>
    <p>Mind Numbing Products is a force in the manufacturing and production market, having produced and manufactured
        nearly every kind of product ever. Our motto is If it’s not Mind Numbing, it’s not worth it.</p>
    <p>This year, the Binaryville Medallion of Honor will be presented to our very own Rivet for his tireless disaster
        relief work in collusion with The Ultimate Robot Disaster Relief Organized Organization, TURDROO [tooltip:
        pronounced ‘TUR-drew’]. Despite his chronic alektorophobia [tooltip: fear of chickens], Rivet has also gone
        beyond binary boundaries, dedicating every Thursday afternoon to egg-sitting for neighborhood fowl as they foray
        into town for grain and karaoke. </p>
