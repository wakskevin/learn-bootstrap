                <p>Bubble Gum robot, or “Bubbles” for short, is from a family of track-footed robots that ¬originated
                    from an experiment melding candy vending machines with robotics in the early 1980s. Bubbles is a
                    favorite of Binaryville, not just because she generously dispenses candy, but also because she has
                    one of the more "bubbly" personalities of the villagers.</p>
