    <h1>The Robot Roundup Vintage Camper Rally Winds Down</h1>
    <img src="../assets/images/robots-camp.png" alt="Robots in Camp" />
    <p>Chipper and cheery jokes, stories, and songs filled the air this week at the 4th Annual Robot Roundup Vintage
        Camper Rally. While this joke doesn't qualify as the funniest, it's the first joke I heard when I walked up to
        the Rally's first bonfire of the week, and was far from being the last. </p>
    <p>There were serious topics on the table, too, such as the ethical dilemma of integrating robotics into a vintage
        camper rebuild in order to better control interior climate and overall power usage. Purists argued that doing
        things "the old-fashioned human way" was the only proper way to camp, and claimed that those who "destroy" the
        authentic-ness of a vintage camper are meanies. It was later unanimously decided that no robot in attendance—no
        matter what their vintage camper preference was—wanted to be a meanie. The purists reluctantly agreed with the
        renovators that they were "free spirited artists" and stated that there is enough room on the planet for
        whatever a person wants to do to their camper.</p>
    <p>A growing number of robots were interested in being on the road full-time. Social media influencers Plam and
        Plotter, co-stars of the Travel-Worn Robots TubeYou channel, shared their experience and tips to transitioning
        to life on the road. After the session, participants were asked to raise a limb to show how many of them were
        interested in living full-time in their camper, and nearly all said they would love to be full-timers at least
        part of the time.</p>
    <p>In short, the 4th Annual Robot Roundup Vintage Camper Rally has been an event to write home about. In fact, I
        wrote several postcards to my family every day—including one that featured my favorite joke of the rally:</p>
