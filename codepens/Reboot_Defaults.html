        <p>Dolores robot is a computational genius who performs calculations for various Binaryville businesses and
            organizations. In her spare time, Dolores has been noodling on the creation of the perfect web browser that
            will make all other browsers obsolete. We're rooting for you, Dolores!</p>

        <h1>Bubbles</h1>
        <p>Bubble Gum robot, or “Bubbles” for short, is from a family of track-footed robots that ¬originated from an
            experiment melding candy vending machines with robotics in the early 1980s. Bubbles is a favorite of
            Binaryville, not just because she generously dispenses candy, but also because she has one of the more
            "bubbly" personalities of the villagers.</p>
